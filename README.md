# Fork notes

This project is still a work in progress. When it is finished, I will lay out the aditional steps to make the IPA converter work.

This is the first software to automatically mark the vowel length of alphas, iotas and ypsilons in Ancient Greek text, a crucial task for any research on Greek prosody and verse. Developed by me, Albin Thörn Cleland, as part of my doctoral research at Lund university, it is geared towards batch macronizing corpora with machine-friendly markup, avoiding combining diacritics and everything that doesn't render in standard IDE and terminal fonts unless specifically asked for.

A quick and superficial presentation of the method and the results is included in [these slides](docs/Makroniserare_Filologkonferensen_25.pdf) (in Swedish).

# Installation

- Create a virtual environment with Python 3.12. Nothing will work if you don't get this step right!
- After having initialized your venv, activate it, make sure you are in the repository root dir and install the package locally with `pip install -e .`
- Check if installation went well by running `python scripts/macronize_tests.py`

# How to use

Start macronizing by running the notebook [here](macronize.ipynb), or by modifying this minimal script:

```
import re

from grc_macronizer import Macronizer

macronizer = Macronizer(make_prints=False)

input = "Δαρείου καὶ Παρυσάτιδος γίγνονται παῖδες δύο, πρεσβύτερος μὲν Ἀρταξέρξης, νεώτερος δὲ Κῦρος"

output = macronizer.macronize(input)

output_split = [sentence for sentence in re.findall(r'[^.\n;\u037e]+[.\n;\u037e]?', output) if sentence]
for line in output_split[:500]:
    print(line)
```

Note that if you have a newer spaCy pipeline for Ancient Greek, it is easy to substitute it for odyCy. Indeed, the *rest of the software has no legacy dependencies and should run with the latest python*.

# Machine Learning

This software was used to prepare training data for different transformer models, which pick up on and generalize the regularities and slightly improve the scores on the [SOTA benchmark for macronization]()
